TODO (in order of priority)
MUSTS for 0.9
- refactor graphics package according to http://pastebin.com/GkLe61zc (remember the JNI portions as well)
- add int button to touch event handlers in InputListener. See http://www.badlogicgames.com/wordpress/?p=1391
- First iteration of gdx2d/Gdx2DPixmap (see current stubs, loading works already), refactoring of Texture and Pixmap accordingly. No more Graphics.newXXX. Think about where managed textures will get reloaded.
- Rewrite the Audio backend http://code.google.com/p/libgdx/issues/detail?id=56, Nate mostly did this already, MP3 decoder missing as of yet.
- Z-ordering of sprites, maybe via z-buffer. If we do it it must be done before AnimatedSprite
- AnimatedSprite
- Implementing Matrix3.inv()
- Additions proposed by Hovox to Actor (see http://code.google.com/p/libgdx/issues/detail?id=74)
- Scaling bitmap fonts as per http://code.google.com/p/libgdx/issues/detail?id=77
- Rework camera classes, Not happy With the distinction at the moment, should be merged and have a flag/mode -> ortho,perspective
- Proper fullscreen support for Lwjgl and Jogl backends, only Angle backend supports it atm

NICE TO HAVES 0.9
- Loaders for new 3D formats (MD2, MD5, Obj, Cal3D, Ogre)
- Rewrite Dave’s stuff a tad bit to make it compatible with GLES 2.0 as well and unify loading and baking for new formats. This mostly concerns Materials (and some optimizations to reduce state changes)
- A very very simple little 3D scene graph API, even simpler than the 2D scenegraph. I believe that a complete scene graph is utter overkill. However, there are use cases were you want to have small hierarchies in your game world for which this API should provide sensible methods and classes
- Spatial partitioning datastructures (Octree, Hashed Grids)
