=== BUILDING FOR WINDOWS, LINUX & ANDROID ===

This folder contains 4 ant files responsible for building the gdx shared libs for win32, win64, lin32 and lin64. They are
intended to be used with ant >= 1.8.1 as well as the common multilib gcc toolchain for linux (x86 and x86_64 targets) and
the mingw w64 linux port (http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/files/Toolchains%20targetting%20Win64/Automated%20Builds/mingw-w64-bin_i686-linux_20101216.tar.bz2/download).
We currently don't support building on Windows directly. If you want to do this you have to change the build-winxxx.xml files.
just replace the prefix with whatever your local Windows MinGW install uses (e.g. the empty string...). Otherwise go this route:

1) Install a nice new and shiny Ubuntu 10.10 (just as an example) 64-bit
2) Install the gcc toolchain via apt
3) Install gcc-multilib via apt for gcc and g++ (package gcc-multilib should suffice and install the correct versions)
4) Install gcc-mingw32 (needed for targeting win32)
5) Fetch MinGW w64 targeting win64 from http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/files/Toolchains%20targetting%20Win64/Automated%20Builds/mingw-w64-bin_i686-linux_20101216.tar.bz2/download
6) unpack it and put it in an accessible directory, e.g. /opt/mingw-w64, then export PATH=$PATH:/opt/mingw-w64/bin
7) Download the latest ant binaries (>= 1.8.1) and extract them to say /opt/ant, then export PATH=$PATH:/opt/ant/bin
8) Download the latest Android NDK and make sure ndk-build is on the PATH
9) set NDK_HOME to the directory you extracted the Android NDK to (e.g. /opt/android-ndk-r5).
8) invoke ant in the directory gdx/jni
9) ...
10) Profit!

This will compile the natives for win32 (gdx.dll), win64 (gdx-64.dll), lin32 (libgdx.so), lin64 (libgdx-64) and Android (arm5, arm7). 
It will also pack them into the gdx-natives.jar which is placed in gdx/natives and used by all the desktop projects in the SVN trunk

Why the separate ant files? Cause i like copy & pasting... I'll write a more generic ant script that can be used by any platform as soon
as time permits. 

MacOSX lovers, i'm afraid you are shit out of luck. Seems like Apple doesn't want people to write software for the super awesome OS.
