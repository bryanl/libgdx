Vector Pinball is a pinball game for Android devices. It is released under 
version 3 of the GPL; see "COPYING" for the license text.

The graphics are deliberately simple; currently everything is drawn with lines and circles. The focus is on gameplay and accurate physics. It uses the libgdx Java wrapper for the Box2D physics engine.

Addtions by Mario Zechner (contact@badlogicgames.com):
- ported to libgdx, 
- all new code is under GPL (see "COPYING"). 
- Slight modifications applied to Field (world.step() iterations set to 4,4). This is just a prove of concept, not as fancy as the original method :) 
- Thanks to Brian for letting me mess with his code officially :)
