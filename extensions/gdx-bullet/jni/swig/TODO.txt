Dev TODO:

- Build on Windows, ARM, Mac OS (update SwigBulletBuild)
- Decide on package names (swigbullet vs. bullet)
- "swig-src" OK name for generated source?
- Remove generation of mathTypesTest.i
- btTransform makes a lot of garbage, reuse one for the returns?

Features not yet finished:

- Generate soft body, gimpact types
    
    Also update the btCollisionShape downcast switch block to include these
    
- Add downcast methods to generated types

	When SWIG generates "class A" and "class B extends A", most methods like
	"A getB()" actually return a concrete A, which can't be downcast to a B.
	
	Need to generate downcast methods on the wrapper types.

- Handle "CUSTOM" btCollisionShape downcasts

- Test perf around largish types crossing boundaries often

	Vector3, Matrix4, and Quaternion should be pretty efficient.  Their 
	floats are directly accessed in JNI.
	
	How about btTransform?  It has a Vector3 and a Matrix3 and they're
	usually accessed together, possibly with another boundary crossing 
	for setIdentity().
	
- Enable and fix vehicle class generation

	They're the only ones I left disabled because of some C++ compile
	issues I didn't care to fix at the time.
	
- Break into modules

 	Collision and dynamics types in separate libraries?  The generated 
 	wrappers are currently huge because they include everything.
 	Maybe disable lesser used features (some shapes? serialization?).
 	
Areas of ongoing maintenance (as upstream Bullet changes):

- Add classes to gdxBullet.i near the bottom

	These are the "simple" classes.  We'll need to add them when Bullet
	does, remove them when Bullet does.
	
- Add new files to "custom" for types with inner classes / structs

	Some classes have inner types that are really useful and they
	need those types declared in .i files.  When they change, we'll
	need to update the class declarations.
	
	We can ignore inner types that won't be useful to gdx users.

- Write more type substitutions like for Vector3, Matrix3, Quaternion

	These make it more pleasant to use Bullet with GDX, and should
	help with performance (fewer bytes copied).
