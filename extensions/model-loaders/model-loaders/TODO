MUST
- MD2Loader should untangle the animations contained in the model file. At the moment we store all frames in "all"
- MD2Loader should generate normals. Hard or soft? Add flag?
- MD2Loader.setAnimation() needs to be implemented properly.
- serialization/deserialization of all model types
- static Model type
- figure out whether normals for SkeletalModel are correct (might be something fishy in the viewer...)

NICE TO HAVE
- AABBs for animation frames of both type of animated models.
- rewrite OgreXML loader to use Nate's XML aids -> Jaxb + Android == no-go
